#Daily Coding Problem #9 [Hard]
#Given a list of integers, write a function that returns the largest sum of non-adjacent numbers.
#Numbers can be 0 or negative.
#For example, [2, 4, 6, 2, 5] should return 13, since we pick 2, 6, and 5.
#[5, 1, 1, 5] should return 10, since we pick 5 and 5.
#Follow-up: Can you do this in O(N) time and constant space?
